    Apply audio timing corrections to help synchronize audio and video in your output. To apply timing corrections, your input must meet the following requirements: * Container: MP4, or MOV, with an accurate time-to-sample (STTS) table. * Audio track: AAC. Choose from the following audio timing correction settings: * Disabled (Default): Apply no correction. * Auto: Recommended for most inputs. MediaConvert analyzes the audio timing in your input and determines which correction setting to use, if needed. * Track: Adjust the duration of each audio frame by a constant amount to align the audio track length with STTS duration. Track-level correction does not affect pitch, and is recommended for tonal audio content such as music. * Frame: Adjust the duration of each audio frame by a variable amount to align audio frames with STTS timestamps. No corrections are made to already-aligned frames. Frame-level correction may affect the pitch of corrected frames, and is recommended for atonal audio content such as speech or percussion.
