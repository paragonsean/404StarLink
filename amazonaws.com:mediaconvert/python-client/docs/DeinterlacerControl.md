# DeinterlacerControl

- When set to NORMAL (default), the deinterlacer does not convert frames that are tagged in metadata as progressive. It will only convert those that are tagged as some other type. - When set to FORCE_ALL_FRAMES, the deinterlacer converts every frame to progressive - even those that are already tagged as progressive. Turn Force mode on only if there is a good chance that the metadata has tagged frames as progressive when they are not progressive. Do not turn on otherwise; processing frames that are already progressive into progressive will probably result in lower quality video.

## Enum

* `FORCE_ALL_FRAMES` (value: `'FORCE_ALL_FRAMES'`)

* `NORMAL` (value: `'NORMAL'`)
