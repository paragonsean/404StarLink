# NielsenSourceWatermarkStatusType

Required. Specify whether your source content already contains Nielsen non-linear watermarks. When you set this value to Watermarked (WATERMARKED), the service fails the job. Nielsen requires that you add non-linear watermarking to only clean content that doesn't already have non-linear Nielsen watermarks.

## Enum

* `CLEAN` (value: `'CLEAN'`)

* `WATERMARKED` (value: `'WATERMARKED'`)
