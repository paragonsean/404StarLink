# DvbSubtitleTeletextSpacing

Specify whether the Text spacing (TeletextSpacing) in your captions is set by the captions grid, or varies depending on letter width. Choose fixed grid (FIXED_GRID) to conform to the spacing specified in the captions file more accurately. Choose proportional (PROPORTIONAL) to make the text easier to read for closed captions. Within your job settings, all of your DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

## Enum

* `FIXED_GRID` (value: `'FIXED_GRID'`)

* `PROPORTIONAL` (value: `'PROPORTIONAL'`)

* `AUTO` (value: `'AUTO'`)
