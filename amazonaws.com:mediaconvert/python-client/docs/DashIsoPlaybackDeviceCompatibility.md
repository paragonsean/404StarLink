# DashIsoPlaybackDeviceCompatibility

This setting can improve the compatibility of your output with video players on obsolete devices. It applies only to DASH H.264 outputs with DRM encryption. Choose Unencrypted SEI (UNENCRYPTED_SEI) only to correct problems with playback on older devices. Otherwise, keep the default setting CENC v1 (CENC_V1). If you choose Unencrypted SEI, for that output, the service will exclude the access unit delimiter and will leave the SEI NAL units unencrypted.

## Enum

* `CENC_V1` (value: `'CENC_V1'`)

* `UNENCRYPTED_SEI` (value: `'UNENCRYPTED_SEI'`)
