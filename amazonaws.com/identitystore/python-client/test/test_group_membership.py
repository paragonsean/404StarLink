    AWS SSO Identity Store

    <p>The Identity Store service used by AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) provides a single place to retrieve all of your identities (users and groups). For more information, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html\">IAM Identity Center User Guide</a>.</p> <pre><code> &lt;note&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the &lt;code&gt;sso&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;identitystore&lt;/code&gt; API namespaces will continue to retain their original name for backward compatibility purposes. For more information, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed&quot;&gt;IAM Identity Center rename&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/note&gt; &lt;p&gt;This reference guide describes the identity store operations that you can call programatically and includes detailed information about data types and errors.&lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>
