    Use Noise reducer filter (NoiseReducerFilter) to select one of the following spatial image filtering functions. To use this setting, you must also enable Noise reducer (NoiseReducer). * Bilateral preserves edges while reducing noise. * Mean (softest), Gaussian, Lanczos, and Sharpen (sharpest) do convolution filtering. * Conserve does min/max noise reduction. * Spatial does frequency-domain filtering based on JND principles. * Temporal optimizes video quality for complex motion.
