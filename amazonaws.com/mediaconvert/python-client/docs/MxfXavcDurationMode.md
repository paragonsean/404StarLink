# MxfXavcDurationMode

To create an output that complies with the XAVC file format guidelines for interoperability, keep the default value, Drop frames for compliance (DROP_FRAMES_FOR_COMPLIANCE). To include all frames from your input in this output, keep the default setting, Allow any duration (ALLOW_ANY_DURATION). The number of frames that MediaConvert excludes when you set this to Drop frames for compliance depends on the output frame rate and duration.

## Enum

* `ALLOW_ANY_DURATION` (value: `'ALLOW_ANY_DURATION'`)

* `DROP_FRAMES_FOR_COMPLIANCE` (value: `'DROP_FRAMES_FOR_COMPLIANCE'`)
