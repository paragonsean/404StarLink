# M2tsBufferModel

Controls what buffer model to use for accurate interleaving. If set to MULTIPLEX, use multiplex buffer model. If set to NONE, this can lead to lower latency, but low-memory devices may not be able to play back the stream without interruptions.

## Enum

* `MULTIPLEX` (value: `'MULTIPLEX'`)

* `NONE` (value: `'NONE'`)
