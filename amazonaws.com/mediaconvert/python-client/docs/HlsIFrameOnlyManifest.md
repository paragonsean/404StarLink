# HlsIFrameOnlyManifest

Choose Include (INCLUDE) to have MediaConvert generate a child manifest that lists only the I-frames for this rendition, in addition to your regular manifest for this rendition. You might use this manifest as part of a workflow that creates preview functions for your video. MediaConvert adds both the I-frame only child manifest and the regular child manifest to the parent manifest. When you don't need the I-frame only child manifest, keep the default value Exclude (EXCLUDE).

## Enum

* `INCLUDE` (value: `'INCLUDE'`)

* `EXCLUDE` (value: `'EXCLUDE'`)
