# SimulateReservedQueue

Enable this setting when you run a test job to estimate how many reserved transcoding slots (RTS) you need. When this is enabled, MediaConvert runs your job from an on-demand queue with similar performance to what you will see with one RTS in a reserved queue. This setting is disabled by default.

## Enum

* `DISABLED` (value: `'DISABLED'`)

* `ENABLED` (value: `'ENABLED'`)
