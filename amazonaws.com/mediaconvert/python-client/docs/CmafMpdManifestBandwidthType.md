Specify how the value for bandwidth is determined for each video Representation in your output MPD manifest. We recommend that you choose a MPD manifest bandwidth type that is compatible with your downstream player configuration. Max: Use the same value that you specify for Max bitrate in the video output, in bits per second. Average: Use the calculated average bitrate of the encoded video output, in bits per second.
