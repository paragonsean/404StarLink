# **git_create_commit**
> GitCommit git_create_commit(owner, repo, git_create_commit_request)

Create a commit

Creates a new Git [commit object](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Internals-Git-Objects#Commit-Objects).  **Signature verification object**  The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:  | Name | Type | Description | | ---- | ---- | ----------- | | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. | | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in the table below. | | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. | | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |  These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:  | Value | Description | | ----- | ----------- | | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. | | `not_signing_key` | The \"signing\" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. | | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. | | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. | | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. | | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. | | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. | | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. | | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. | | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. | | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. | | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. | | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

import openapi_client
from openapi_client.models.git_create_ref_request import GitCreateRefRequest
from openapi_client.models.git_ref import GitRef
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://github.com

    owner = 'owner_example' # str | The account owner of the repository. The name is not case sensitive.
    repo = 'repo_example' # str | The name of the repository. The name is not case sensitive.
    git_create_ref_request = {"ref":"refs/heads/featureA","sha":"aa218f56b14c9653891f9e74264a383fa43fefbd"} # GitCreateRefRequest | 

    try:
        # Create a reference

# **git_create_tag**
> GitTag git_create_tag(owner, repo, git_create_tag_request)

Create a tag object

Note that creating a tag object does not create the reference that makes a tag in Git. If you want to create an annotated tag in Git, you have to do this call to create the tag object, and then [create](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/reference/git#create-a-reference) the `refs/tags/[tag]` reference. If you want to create a lightweight tag, you only have to [create](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/reference/git#create-a-reference) the tag reference - this call would be unnecessary.  **Signature verification object**  The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:  | Name | Type | Description | | ---- | ---- | ----------- | | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. | | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. | | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. | | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |  These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:  | Value | Description | | ----- | ----------- | | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. | | `not_signing_key` | The \"signing\" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. | | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. | | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. | | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. | | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. | | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. | | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. | | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. | | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. | | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. | | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. | | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

# **git_create_tree**
> GitTree git_create_tree(owner, repo, git_create_tree_request)

Create a tree

The tree creation API accepts nested entries. If you specify both a tree and a nested path modifying that tree, this endpoint will overwrite the contents of the tree with the new path contents, and create a new tree structure.  If you use this endpoint to add, delete, or modify the file contents in a tree, you will need to commit the tree and then update a branch to point to the commit. For more information see \"[Create a commit](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/reference/git#create-a-commit)\" and \"[Update a reference](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/reference/git#update-a-reference).\"  Returns an error if you try to delete a file that does not exist.

# **git_get_ref**
> GitRef git_get_ref(owner, repo, ref)

Get a reference

Returns a single reference from your Git database. The `:ref` in the URL must be formatted as `heads/<branch name>` for branches and `tags/<tag name>` for tags. If the `:ref` doesn't match an existing ref, a `404` is returned.  **Note:** You need to explicitly [request a pull request](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/reference/pulls#get-a-pull-request) to trigger a test merge commit, which checks the mergeability of pull requests. For more information, see \"[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)\".

# **git_get_tree**
> GitTree git_get_tree(owner, repo, tree_sha, recursive=recursive)

Get a tree

Returns a single tree using the SHA1 value for that tree.  If `truncated` is `true` in the response then the number of items in the `tree` array exceeded our maximum limit. If you need to fetch more items, use the non-recursive method of fetching trees, and fetch one sub-tree at a time.   **Note**: The limit for the `tree` array is 100,000 entries with a maximum size of 7 MB when using the `recursive` parameter.

### Example


```python
import openapi_client
from openapi_client.models.git_tree import GitTree
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://github.com
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.

    repo = 'repo_example' # str | The name of the repository. The name is not case sensitive.
    tree_sha = 'tree_sha_example' # str | 
    recursive = 'recursive_example' # str | Setting this parameter to any value returns the objects or subtrees referenced by the tree specified in `:tree_sha`. For example, setting `recursive` to any of the following will enable returning objects or subtrees: `0`, `1`, `\"true\"`, and `\"false\"`. Omit this parameter to prevent recursively returning objects or subtrees. (optional)

    try:
        # Get a tree
        api_response = api_instance.git_get_tree(owner, repo, tree_sha, recursive=recursive)
        print("The response of GitApi->git_get_tree:\n")
        pprint(api_response)

# **git_list_matching_refs**
> List[GitRef] git_list_matching_refs(owner, repo, ref)

List matching references

Returns an array of references from your Git database that match the supplied name. The `:ref` in the URL must be formatted as `heads/<branch name>` for branches and `tags/<tag name>` for tags. If the `:ref` doesn't exist in the repository, but existing refs start with `:ref`, they will be returned as an array.  When you use this endpoint without providing a `:ref`, it will return an array of all the references from your Git database, including notes and stashes if they exist on the server. Anything in the namespace is returned, not just `heads` and `tags`.  **Note:** You need to explicitly [request a pull request](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/reference/pulls#get-a-pull-request) to trigger a test merge commit, which checks the mergeability of pull requests. For more information, see \"[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.4/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)\".  If you request matching references for a branch named `feature` but the branch `feature` doesn't exist, the response can still include other matching head refs that start with the word `feature`, such as `featureA` and `featureB`.
