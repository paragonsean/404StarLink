# openapi-client
Finds shortest/fastest route between a start point and one or more stop points on British Columbia's public road network. The BC Route planner [webpage](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=9D99E684CCD042CD88FADC51E079B4B5) provides additional information.

## Requirements.

Python 3.7+

## Installation & Usage
### pip install

If the python package is hosted on a repository, you can install directly using:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git
```
(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git`)

Then import the package:
```python
import openapi_client
```

### Setuptools

Install via [Setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).

```sh
python setup.py install --user
```
(or `sudo python setup.py install` to install the package for all users)

Then import the package:
```python
import openapi_client
```

### Tests

Execute `pytest` to run the tests.

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```python

import openapi_client
from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://router.api.gov.bc.ca
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = openapi_client.Configuration(
    host = "https://router.api.gov.bc.ca"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: apikey
configuration.api_key['apikey'] = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['apikey'] = 'Bearer'


# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:

    route_description = 'Routing results' # str | Route description (e.g., Shortest route from 1002 Johnson St, Victoria to 1105 Royal Ave,New Westminster) (optional) (default to 'Routing results')

    try:
