        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\"\
        >session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy\
        \ document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to\
        \ 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session\
        \ policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session\
        \ policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation\
        \ returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are\
        \ the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies.\
        \ You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services\
        \ API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot\
        \ use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the\
        \ identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information,\
        \ see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\"\
        >Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you create\
        \ a role, you create two policies: A role trust policy that specifies <i>who</i>\
        \ can assume the role and a permissions policy that specifies <i>what</i>\
        \ can be done with the role. You specify the trusted principal who is allowed\
        \ to assume the role in the role trust policy.</p> <p>To assume a role from\
        \ a different account, your Amazon Web Services account must be trusted by\
        \ the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when\
        \ the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed\
        \ to delegate that access to users in the account. </p> <p>A user who wants\
        \ to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that\
        \ are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must\
        \ attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for\
        \ the ARN of the role in the other account.</p> <p>To allow a user to assume\
        \ a role in the same account, you can do either of the following:</p> <ul>\
        \ <li> <p>Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code>\
        \ (as long as the role's trust policy trusts the account).</p> </li> <li>\
        \ <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p>\
        \ </li> </ul> <p>You can do either because the role’s trust policy acts as\
        \ an IAM resource-based policy. When a resource-based policy grants access\
        \ to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy\
        \ is required. For more information about trust policies and resource-based\
        \ policies, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html\"\
        >IAM Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional)\
        \ You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are called\
        \ session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html\"\
        >Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>An administrator\
        \ must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator\
        \ can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific\
        \ session tags. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html\"\
        >Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM\

        >Chaining Roles with Session Tags</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>\
        \ <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can include multi-factor\
        \ authentication (MFA) information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>.\
        \ This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that\
        \ assumes the role has been authenticated with an Amazon Web Services MFA\
        \ device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes\
        \ a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include\
        \ valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition\
        \ in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the\
        \ following example.</p> <p> <code>\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\"\
        : true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\"\
        >Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p>\
        \ <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code>\
        \ and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value\
        \ identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code>\
        \ is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces.\

        >Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>When you create\
        \ a role, you create two policies: A role trust policy that specifies <i>who</i>\
        \ can assume the role and a permissions policy that specifies <i>what</i>\
        \ can be done with the role. You specify the trusted principal who is allowed\
        \ to assume the role in the role trust policy.</p> <p>To assume a role from\
        \ a different account, your Amazon Web Services account must be trusted by\
        \ the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when\
        \ the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed\
        \ to delegate that access to users in the account. </p> <p>A user who wants\
        \ to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that\
        \ are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must\
        \ attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for\
        \ the ARN of the role in the other account.</p> <p>To allow a user to assume\
        \ a role in the same account, you can do either of the following:</p> <ul>\
        \ <li> <p>Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code>\
        \ (as long as the role's trust policy trusts the account).</p> </li> <li>\
        \ <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p>\
        \ </li> </ul> <p>You can do either because the role’s trust policy acts as\
        \ an IAM resource-based policy. When a resource-based policy grants access\
        \ to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy\
        \ is required. For more information about trust policies and resource-based\
        \ policies, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html\"\

        \ This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that\
        \ assumes the role has been authenticated with an Amazon Web Services MFA\
        \ device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes\
        \ a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include\
        \ valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition\
        \ in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the\
        \ following example.</p> <p> <code>\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\"\
        : true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\"\

        \ <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code>\
        \ and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value\
        \ identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code>\

        \ or the Amazon Web Services account root user. Access key IDs beginning with\
        \ <code>ASIA</code> are temporary credentials that are created using STS operations.\
        \ If the account in the response belongs to you, you can sign in as the root\

        \ duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds\
        \ (36 hours). The default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary\
        \ credentials obtained by using the Amazon Web Services account root user\
        \ credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b>\
        \ </p> <p>You can use the temporary credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code>\
        \ in any Amazon Web Services service with the following exceptions:</p> <ul>\
        \ <li> <p>You cannot call any IAM operations using the CLI or the Amazon Web\
        \ Services API. This limitation does not apply to console sessions.</p> </li>\
        \ <li> <p>You cannot call any STS operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p>\
        \ </li> </ul> <p>You can use temporary credentials for single sign-on (SSO)\
        \ to the console.</p> <p>You must pass an inline or managed <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\"\
        >session policy</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document\
        \ to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed\
        \ policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies.\
        \ The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies\
        \ can't exceed 2,048 characters.</p> <p>Though the session policy parameters\
        \ are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated\
        \ user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the session\
        \ permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session\
        \ policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions\
        \ for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions\
        \ than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For\
        \ more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\"\

        \ permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition\
        \ to the permissions granted by the session policies.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b>\
        \ </p> <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These\
        \ are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a\

        >Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note>\

        \ </note> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to\
        \ pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions\
        \ to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see\

        \ <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>The <code>GetSessionToken</code> operation\
        \ must be called by using the long-term Amazon Web Services security credentials\
        \ of the Amazon Web Services account root user or an IAM user. Credentials\
        \ that are created by IAM users are valid for the duration that you specify.\
        \ This duration can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of\
        \ 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with a default of 43,200 seconds (12 hours).\
        \ Credentials based on account credentials can range from 900 seconds (15\
        \ minutes) up to 3,600 seconds (1 hour), with a default of 1 hour. </p> <p>\
        \ <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by\
        \ <code>GetSessionToken</code> can be used to make API calls to any Amazon\
        \ Web Services service with the following exceptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You\
        \ cannot call any IAM API operations unless MFA authentication information\
        \ is included in the request.</p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot call any STS API\
        \ <i>except</i> <code>AssumeRole</code> or <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p>\
        \ </li> </ul> <note> <p>We recommend that you do not call <code>GetSessionToken</code>\
        \ with Amazon Web Services account root user credentials. Instead, follow\
        \ our <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users\"\
        >best practices</a> by creating one or more IAM users, giving them the necessary\
        \ permissions, and using IAM users for everyday interaction with Amazon Web\
        \ Services. </p> </note> <p>The credentials that are returned by <code>GetSessionToken</code>\
        \ are based on permissions associated with the user whose credentials were\
        \ used to call the operation. If <code>GetSessionToken</code> is called using\
        \ Amazon Web Services account root user credentials, the temporary credentials\
        \ have root user permissions. Similarly, if <code>GetSessionToken</code> is\
        \ called using the credentials of an IAM user, the temporary credentials have\
